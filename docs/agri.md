# Nature and Agriculture

I believe in connecting with our roots and that we have to strengthen our villages, improve agriculture for sustainability as well as profitability, and keep a check on water and air pollution.

Global warming is a big threat [^1] not just in terms of rising water levels but also the amount of heat India and the world have received in the past couple of years is damaging life and economy.
This is affecting the economy by targeting the productivity of humans and the usability of time. Hot hours have become unsuitable for working in open spaces. And even in closed spaces, the usage of air conditioners has become inevitable. ACs are not the solution but the part of a bigger problem. They cool an enclosed space but warm the surrounding which was otherwise liveable.

This poses a tremendous opportunity too to capitalise on the excess of energy we are receiving from the sun. We have always been energy deficient, be it for productive, destructive, or exploratory work. But the major issue has been the storage rather than the availability.

Nature demands efforts and simplicity rather than convenience.

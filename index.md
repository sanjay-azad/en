# About Me 


Hello, this is Sanjay Azad.
I am 29 years old and have expertise in machine learning, artificial intelligence, analytics, and signal processing.
I completed my post-graduation (B.Tech. + M.Tech.) from [IIT Bombay] in 2016 from the [Department of Electrical Engineering] with a specialisation in communication and signal processing.


I have 7+ years of professional experience in data science, ML engineering, consulting, and application development and have worked on all three verticals of [MLOps]: data engineering, model building, and model deployment. I have done a good amount of research on explainable and responsible AI and, nowadays, am exploring the capabilities of [Generative AI] and privacy-enhancing technologies ([PETs]). I have primarily worked in the finance, trading, and insurance sectors.


Passionate about nature, gardening and agriculture enthusiast, and vocal for sustainable development - in the sense that our resources have to be used skillfully and efficiently, I believe in the three gems of our existence:
- Compassion, Humility, and Frugality


I live in India and have visited several of its cities and religious and historical sites. The holy city of [Varanasi] is where I have spent the whole of my childhood and schooling.


I have appeared for the [UPSC] civil service exams as well, and the learning it provided in terms of understanding Indian politics, history, and society has been wholesome and fulfilling to me. I have a good knowledge of Indian philosophy from the IIT itself, and nowadays, I am getting into psychology as I believe AI and psychology are going to rule the future.


{: .highlight }
I am a student of science, a proud critical thinker, and a seeker of knowledge.


The information, facts, and theories that I have acquired over my life are my assets. I am willing to disseminate them over here to a larger audience. The blogs are going to be from a diverse background, but mostly will have the following flavours:
- Finance
- Machine learning
- Deep learning
- History and polity
- Nature and Agriculture
- Indian culture and philosophies

# Indian Philosophy

Indian culture and history has been a source of fascination to me. Its traditional and ancient knowledge system woven into the fabric of mythology and religious philosophies (spirituality) are astounding. They can prove to be a disruptive technology for human cognition in today's world of chaos and sufferings.


Indian philosophy is broadly those evolution of thoughts that developed in the Indian subcontinent since the dawn of human intellact. Humans have a primitive urge to know more, and this is reflected in their quest towards science and spirituality. In ancient terms - this used to be called *darshan* in Sanskrit / Hindi, meaning to look deeply. There are various schools of thought that developed - contesting and debating each other.

So, the schools of thoughts that developed in the Indian subcontinent can be put into two buckets - vedic & non-vedic. Vedic thinking are those that derive their say out of the Vedas and supporting texts & interpretations. Non-Vedic are those schools of thoughts that don't have Vedas as authority.


Among the non-Vedic (or unorthodox) schools are the ascetic traditions of Buddhism, Jainism, Charvaka / Lokayatas, and Ajivikas - to name a few. 
Charvaka people believed in the hedonistic way of living. They gave material pleasure and joyful living as the prime motive of humanity, and that pleasure seeking is the utmost thing that humans should do. Ajivikas were just the opposite. They believed in *Niyati*, or the fate so much so that they shuned all sort of human pursuits. Their faith in the workings of Uninverse was huge - that they realised there is no pojnt in doing anything, and that everything will be taken care of by the determinism of life. For them, there in no place for will-power.

Both of these philosophies, although completely opposite - had one thing in common. Both knew that all we know, and could ever know is very limited. So they forsake the idea of looking further. One started seeking all the pleasures that life has to offer, and the other left everything to niyati. Eventually both the thoughts seemed to die down as we dont find followers of such faith nowadays in public. Both did not believe in life after death.

Buddhism and Jainism talk about soul and rebirth, discarding external pleasures for the internal good. They prescribe Nirvana or Kaivalya to be the ultimate human goal - where the soul reaches its highesst state. They do not believe in a creator sense of God. The knowledge is essence here - and they prescribe the path of rightful knowledge.


Coming on to the Vedic traditions or thoughts, we have six *darshanas*:
1. Sankhya
2. Yoga
3. Nyaya
4. Vaisheshika
5. Mimansa
6. Vedanta

The whole discussion among these thoughts revolve around the nature of reality, sources of knowledge and the theory of creation. There are debates over dualism and non-dualism, as to what the true Reality is composed of. Even though they all obtain their arguments from the Vedas, but they differ in so many ways - and yet, exhibit an extreme level of intellact and thought process. These are refined over several centuries of thinking.

# Indian Philosophy


Indian culture and history have been a source of fascination for me. Its traditional and ancient knowledge systems woven into the fabric of mythology and religious philosophies (spirituality) are astounding. They can prove to be a disruptive technology for human cognition in today's world of chaos and suffering.



Indian philosophy is broadly defined as the evolution of thoughts that have developed on the Indian subcontinent since the dawn of human intelligence. Humans have a primitive urge to know more, and this is reflected in their quest towards science and spirituality. In ancient terms, this used to be called *darshan* in Sanskrit or Hindi, meaning to look deeply. There are various schools of thought that developed, contesting and debating each other.


So, the schools of thought that developed in the Indian subcontinent can be put into two buckets: vedic and non-vedic. Vedic thinkers are those who derive their ideas from the Vedas and supporting texts and interpretations. Non-Vedic are those schools of thought that don't have Vedas as authority.



Among the non-Vedic (or unorthodox) schools are the ascetic traditions of Buddhism, Jainism, Charvaka, Lokayatas, and Ajivikas, to name a few.
Charvaka people believed in a hedonistic way of living. They gave material pleasure and joyful living as the prime motives of humanity, and that pleasure seeking is the utmost thing that humans should do. The Ajivikas were just the opposite. They believed in *Niyati*, or fate, so much so that they shunned all sorts of human pursuits. Their faith in the workings of Uninverse was huge - they realised there is no point in doing anything and that everything will be taken care of by the determinism of life. For them, there is no place for willpower.


Both of these philosophies, although completely opposite, had one thing in common. Both knew that all we know and could ever know is very limited. So they forsake the idea of looking further. One started seeking all the pleasures that life has to offer, and the other left everything to Niyati. Eventually, both thoughts seemed to die down, as we don't find followers of such faith nowadays in public. Both did not believe in life after death.


Buddhism and Jainism talk about the soul and rebirth, discarding external pleasures for the internal good. They prescribe Nirvana, or Kaivalya, to be the ultimate human goal - where the soul reaches its highest state. They do not believe in a creator sense of God. The knowledge is essence here, and they prescribe the path of rightful knowledge.



Coming on to the Vedic traditions or thoughts, we have six darshanas:
1. Sankhya
2. Yoga
3. Nyaya
4. Vaisheshika
5. Mimansa
6. Vedanta


The whole discussion among these thoughts revolves around the nature of reality, sources of knowledge, and the theory of creation. There are debates over dualism and non-dualism as to what true reality is composed of. Even though they all obtain their arguments from the Vedas, they differ in so many ways and yet exhibit an extreme level of intelligence and thought process. These are refined over several centuries of thinking.

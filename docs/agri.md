# Nature and Agriculture

I believe in connecting with our roots and that we have to strengthen our villages, improve agriculture for sustainability as well as profitability, and keep a check on water and air pollution.


Global warming is a big threat [^1] - not just in terms of rising water levels but also the amount of heat India and the world have received in the past couple of years.
This is affecting the economy by targeting the productivity of humans and the usability of time. Hot hours have become unsuitable for working in open spaces, and even in closed spaces, the usage of air conditioners has become inevitable.

This poses a tremendous opportunity to capitalise on the excess energy we are receiving from the sun. We have always been energy deficient, be it for productive, destructive, or exploratory work. But the major issue is storage rather than availability.

Nature demands efforts and simplicity rather than convenience.

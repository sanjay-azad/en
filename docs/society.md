# Society

Humans are social animals, and we are driven by beliefs and stories that bind us together.

We forge connections, work in collaboration, and create enemies on the basis of our beliefs and the stories that we relate to. Each individual has multiple facets and personalities; as a result, they relate to some or other groups or communities. This creates a distinction between 'Us' and 'They' on multiple levels. Modern societies have shown signs of maturity in terms of accommodating differences, but it has the scope of creating more facets, or individuals, and deeper identification with communities, resulting in widespread hatred.

We have to identify that hatred and affection are the two faces of the same coin. The coin is our sense of strong identification with our beliefs.

The whole polity, economy, and religions are being led by such beliefs. We think democracy is the best form of government we have devised. But at a time when people themselves don't know how their belief system is being manipulated, relying on their instinct and judgement is a suicidal system.

Humans are social animals, and we are driven by beliefs and stories. We forge connections, work in collaboration, and create enemity on the basis of our beliefs, and the stories that we relate to. Each individual has multiple facets and personalities - as a result, they relate to some or the other groups or communities. This creates a distinction of 'Us' vs 'They' on multiple levels. Modern societies have shown signs of maturity in terms of accomodating differences - but it has a scope of creating more facets or individuals, and deeper identification with communities, resulting in widespread hatred.

We have to identify that the hatred and affection are the two faces of the same coin. The coin is our sense of strong identification with our beliefs.

The whole polity, economy and religions are being led by such beliefs. We think democracy is the best form of government we have devised. But at a time, when people themselves don't know how their belief system is being manipulated - relying on their instinct and judgement is a suicidal system.

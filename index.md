# To begin, begin!
{: .fs-9 }

Hello, this is Sanjay Azad.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

I am 29 years old and have expertise in machine learning, artificial intelligence, analytics, and signal processing.
I completed my post-graduation (B.Tech. + M.Tech.) from [IIT Bombay] in 2016 from the [Department of Electrical Engineering] with a specialisation in communication and signal processing.


I have 7+ years of professional experience in data science, ML engineering, consulting, and application development and have worked on all three verticals of [MLOps]: data engineering, model building, and model deployment. I have done a good amount of research on explainable and responsible AI and, nowadays, am exploring the capabilities of [Generative AI] and privacy-enhancing technologies ([PETs]). I have primarily worked in the finance, trading, and insurance sectors.


Passionate about nature, gardening and agriculture enthusiast, and vocal for sustainable development - in the sense that our resources have to be used skillfully and efficiently, I believe in the three gems of our existence:
- Compassion, Humility, and Frugality


I live in India and have visited several of its cities and religious and historical sites. The holy city of [Varanasi] is where I have spent the whole of my childhood and schooling.


I have appeared for the [UPSC] civil service exams as well, and the learning it provided in terms of understanding Indian politics, history, and society has been wholesome and fulfilling to me. The humanities courses at IIT provided a good knowledge of Indian philosophy, and economy. I believe AI and mindfulness are going to play a bigger role in the future.


{: .highlight }
I am a student of science, a proud critical thinker, and a seeker of knowledge.

<!-- Coming from a background of science and spirituality, I think I should talk about their fallacies and utilities - and save people from getting polarised. -->
The blogs here are going to be from a diverse background, but they will mostly have the following flavors:
- Finance
- Machine learning
- Deep learning
- History and polity
- Nature and Agriculture
- Indian culture and philosophies

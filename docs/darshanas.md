Indian culture and history have been a source of fascination for me. Its traditional and ancient knowledge systems woven into the fabric of mythology and religious philosophies (spirituality) are astounding. 

Indian philosophy is broadly defined as the evolution of thoughts that have developed on the Indian subcontinent since the dawn of human intelligence. Humans have a primitive urge to know more, and this is reflected in their quest towards science and spirituality. In ancient terms, this used to be called *darshan* in Sanskrit or Hindi, meaning to look deeply. There are various schools of thought that developed, contesting and debating each other.

Talking in chronology terms, we have Vedas as the earliest known sources of knowledge. They are so old that some people consider them to be of godly origin. Some call them to be self-manifested, but scientifically - they must have been compiled by great thinkers and sages over several of the centuries.
So, the schools of thought that developed in the Indian subcontinent can be put into two buckets: vedic and non-vedic. Vedic thinkers are those who derive their ideas from the Vedas and supporting texts and interpretations. Non-Vedic are those schools of thought that don't have Vedas as authority.

We have 4 Vedas: Rigveda, Samveda, Yajurveda, Atharvaveda
The constituting documents of each of these vedas could be many books, not a single one - and those are classified into 4 groups:
- Samhitas (mantras and benedictions)
- Brahmanas (commentaries on and explanation of rituals, ceremonies and sacrifices - Yajnas)
- Aranyakas (text on rituals, practices, ceremonies, sacrifices and symbolic-sacrifices)
- Upanishads (texts discussing meditation, philosophy and spiritual knowledge)

Vedas are *shruti-granth* ("what is heard"), distinguishing them from other religious texts like *Puranas*, which are called *smriti* ("what is remembered")

Among the non-Vedic (or unorthodox) schools are the ascetic traditions of Buddhism, Jainism and Ajivikas, and the materialism of Charvaka / Lokayatas.
Charvaka people believed in a hedonistic way of living. They asserted material pleasures and joyful living as the prime motives of humanity, and that pleasure seeking is the utmost thing that humans should do. The Ajivikas were just the opposite. They believed in *Niyati*, or fate, so much so that they shunned all sorts of human pursuits. Their faith in the workings of Universe was huge - they realised there is no point in doing anything and that everything will be taken care of by the determinism of life. For them, there is no place for will-power.

Both of these thoughts sandwich western nihilism between them - one disregards any moral obligation and the other denies any fruitful pursuit.
Both of these philosophies, although completely opposite, had one thing in commonc - both knew that all we know and could ever know is very limited. So they forsake the idea of looking and inquiring. One started seeking all the pleasures that life has to offer, and the other left everything to Niyati. Eventually, both thoughts seemed to die down, as we don't find followers of such faith nowadays in public. Both did not believe in life after death.


<!-- Buddhism and Jainism talk about the soul and rebirth, discarding external pleasures for the internal good. They prescribe Nirvana, or Kaivalya, to be the ultimate human goal - where the soul reaches its highest state. They do not believe in a creator sense of God. The knowledge is essence here, and they prescribe the path of rightful knowledge. -->
We'll discuss Buddhism and Jainism in the coming chapters.


Coming on to the Vedic traditions or thoughts, we have six darshanas:
1. Sankhya
2. Yoga
3. Nyaya
4. Vaisheshika
5. Mimansa
6. Vedanta


The whole discussion among these thoughts revolves around the nature of reality, sources of knowledge, and the theory of creation. There are debates over dualism and non-dualism as to what true reality is composed of. Even though they all obtain their arguments from the Vedas, they differ in so many ways and yet exhibit an extreme level of intelligence and thought process. These are refined over several centuries of thinking.

Why such questions are of significance for centuries?

- what is the true nature of Reality?
It dawns to us that there is something beyond our knowledge and understanding, when we see the change and the momentary and relativistic nature of our experiences. Falseness is known only in the hindsight.

- what should we consider true source of knowledge?
The discussion about truth lands us on this question as to what should be considered the valid source of knowledge, as even our senses seem to fool us and cover the wisdom.

- how do we understand the creation process of Universe, and space beyond?
This question becomes relevant when we understand the past in terms of causality. Things are happening in sequence, so something must be the root of everything, and that can allow us see the Reality - uncluttered.

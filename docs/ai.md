## Introduction
Artificial Intelligence is an umbrella term. It includes different *scientific* ways through which we obtain an intelligent system outside the natural *life* systems.
Here, we try to put in machines some sort of reasoning, decision making and cognition.

It is important to define two of the terms above - Life & Scientific.

**Life:** We all know that living beings on Earth are endowed with some intelligence to undergo their life processes and activities. They take actions based on their bodily needs and their body manufactures and processes hormones and electrical impulses. Thus, they ensure the survival of their species through a process of evolution. The intelligence that drives this whole process is called life. We feel and we believe - and that shapes how we behave towards external triggers. Some beliefs are inherent, and some we formulate as we live. If there is an intelligence - there is constant learning. How we share our learnings depends on our level of communication and cooperation which is again a measure of intelligence.

**Science:** There is a lot of misconception around its utility and contribution - primarily because its definition is not clear to the public. Anything which is systematic and objective comes under science. All sorts of knowledge - true or untrue, if it has been derived by following a systematic procedure and if it is objective in nature, ie, can be imparted through teaching with zero variability - then this knowledge is scientific. As soon as there is a subjectivity in a topic, it goes outside science, eg, spirituality - which is based on personal experience, and there is no way to reporduce the exact same result on two diffeernt persons (at least for now).

Mathematics is science, counting system is science, language is science, psychology is science - as they are based on conventions or theories that are objective (or we have made them so). The belief, in India, that if a cat crosses our way - it results in a bad journey, is not scientific and is, in fact, a superstition. Why? Because this fact is not reproducible. We are not downgrading it from kowledge. It remains a knowledge as somebody or a group of people (let's say 100 out of 1000) might have experienced this correlation. But, that does not make it a scientific fact. So is the case of spiritual experiences, beliefs and encounters. 

So, the scope of science is ever increasing as we encapsulate & systemetize more and more of our *life* knowledge, and make it objective (worthy to be imparted with zero variability). Thus, we accept that the Science is always limited - purposefully, as it does not accept any subjectivity. Also, it need not be error free. The catch here is that, while relying on science - we are relying on our sense organs, which are not fool-proof.

There are a few measures of intelligence - understanding patterns, decision making, language understanding, will-power and emotions.
Emotions and belief framing are the least understood aspects of intelligence as per science - as there is a lot of variability.

Machine learning and deep learning (neural networks) are some of the ways to have an artificially-intelligent agent. Others include robotics, control system, game engines, material technology, etc.

Below is a concise explanation of how those lesser known, other facets of AI exist:
1. **Robotics:** It could be a combination of rule based systems, sensors - along with language & visual processing, and control system. The hand and leg movement are precise due to control system, and sensors provide *interactivity*.
2. **Control Systems:** They include the mechanism through which mathematical calculations guide the process speed and momentum. The famous PID control system allows for the automated driving of a line follower bot. It cptures the *precision* aspect of intelligence.
3. **Game engines:** Games have always been a part of the computer systems, and the intelligence they derive come from the fast *computations* and the *memory* management of the computers. They can pre-compute the future possibiites while designing the current game-flow. A famous example is chess engine.
4. **Material technology:** The intelligence we derive because of the inherent properties of different material & nano particles sums up another method of having AI agents. A particular example is the smart nanomaterials that find usage in biomedicals. Others include stealth technology, and smart building materials.


Let's now quickly cover ML and DL, that are promising a good future to AI - primarily because of an exponential growth in data and computational capabilities in recent years.
Here, we enable a machine to perform over the above mentioned measures of intelligence - while we can't feed in all the possible decision rules and pattern matchings beforehand. The machine has to make out statistical inferences about the decision rules & patterns from the available limited example scenarios (or data).

The few scenarios that we make available to the machine are called training data.
If the training data are labelled from the real world (like a cat image - along with label: Cat), the learning that happens is called **Supervised learning**. The machine then figures out the labels for the unobserved test data by itself. Generally, we do three sets of tasks here - *Regression, Classification & Ranking*.
Similarly, if we train it without the labels to make some associations among the given scenarios (or training data) - like *Segment / Cluster* them, and do the same with any unobserved scenario then it is called an **Unsupervised learning**.

There are several different mathematical models or algorithms for these two types of learnings. There is a third type of learning called **Reinforcement learning**, where we create an agent that learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions. Below are few terms that need our further attention:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Process to make a system or agent that can understand and generate human language, enabling it to interact with users through text or speech.
- Computer Vision: Image processing to make system or agents capable of processing and interpreting visual information, allowing them to understand and interact with images and videos.
- Neural Networks: Models designed to mimic brain functionality through neurons, also called deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for vision tasks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential data, to build intelligent agents or systems.

Developing an artificially intelligent agent requires expertise in AI, machine learning, and software development, as well as access to suitable data and computational resources. It's also important to consider the ethical and practical implications of deploying AI agents in various applications.

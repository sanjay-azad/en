AI is an umbrella term, where machines are made intelligent in terms of decision making and cognition.

There are few metrics of intelligence as a human - understanding patterns, decision making, language understanding and emotions.
The last one being the most difficult to put in an intelligent system, is the most dreaded feature a machine could acquire.

Machine learning and deep learning are some ways to teach a machine to function properly when all the possible scenarios in a use case are not available beforehand to the machine. Thus the machine has to make out statistical inferences from the available limited example scenarios.

The few scenarios that we make available to the machine are called training data and the learning that happens is called supervised learning.

In the case when we have to make some associations among the given scenarios - like rank or segment them, and do the same with any unobserved scenario then the learning is called unsupervised.

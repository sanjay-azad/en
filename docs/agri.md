I believe in connecting with our roots and that we have to strengthen our villages, improvise on agriculture - in sustainability as well as profitability, and keep a check on water and air pollution.

Global warming is a big threat[^1] - not just in terms of rising water levels but also the amount of heat India and the World is receiving in past couple of years. 
This is affecting economy by targetting the productivity of humans and the usability of time. Hot hours have become unsuitable for working in open, and even in closed space the usage of air conditioners have become inevitable.


This poses a tremendous opportunity to capitalise on the excess energy we are receiving from the sun. We have always been energy deficient - be it for productive, destructive, or exploratory work. But the major issue is in storing rather than the availability.

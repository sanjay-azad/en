# Artificial Intelligence


Artificial intelligence is an umbrella term. It includes different *scientific* ways through which we obtain an intelligent system, outside the natural *life* systems.
Here, we try to put into machines some sort of reasoning, decision-making, and cognition.


To understand AI, it is important to talk a bit about the terms above: life and science.


**Life:** We all know that living beings on Earth are endowed with some intelligence to undergo their life processes and activities. They take actions based on their bodily needs, and their body manufactures hormones and processes electrical impulses. Thus, they ensure the survival of their species through evolution. The intelligence that drives this whole process is called life. We feel and we believe, and that shapes how we behave towards external triggers. Some beliefs are inherent, and some we formulate as we live. Our intelligence is responsible for our constant learning. We share those learnings through certain levels of communication and cooperation, which is itself a measure of intelligence.


**Science:** Anything that is systematic, structured, and objective comes under the category of science. All sorts of knowledge, true or untrue, if it has been derived by following a systematic procedure and if it is objective in nature, i.e., can be imparted through teaching with zero variability, then this knowledge is scientific. There is a lot of doubt around the utility and contribution of science, mostly because its definition is not clear to the public and partly because it has been used by human greed to exploit resources.


{: .note }
Mathematics is science, counting systems are science, language is science, and psychology is science, as they are based on conventions or theories that are objective (or we have made them so).


As soon as there is subjectivity in knowledge, it goes outside of science, e.g., spirituality, which is based on personal experience, and there is no way to replicate the exact same result on two different people (at least for now).


The belief, in India, that if a cat crosses our way, it results in a bad journey, is not scientific and is, in fact, a superstition. Why? This fact is not reproducible. We are not downgrading it from knowledge. It remains a known fact that somebody or a group of people (let's say 100 out of 1000) might have experienced this correlation. But that does not make it a scientific fact. So is the case with personal experiences, beliefs, and encounters.


So, the scope of science is ever-increasing as we encapsulate and systematise more and more of our life knowledge and make it objective (worthy of being imparted with zero variability). Thus, we accept that science is always limited - purposefully, as it does not accept any subjectivity. Also, it need not be error-free. The catch here is that, while relying on the objectivity of science, we are relying on our sense organs, which are not foolproof.


{: .highlight }
There is intelligence in both of them - life and science. It's just that science is more structured, definite, and limited. There are a few measures of intelligence: understanding patterns, decision-making, language understanding, willpower, and emotions.
Emotions and belief-framing are the least understood aspects of intelligence, as per science, as there is a lot of variability.


Artificially intelligent agents are those scientific systems that cross certain thresholds at the above-mentioned measures of intelligence (in human perception).
Machine learning and deep learning (neural networks) are some of the ways to have an AI agent. Others include robotics, control systems, game engines, material technology, etc.


Below is a concise explanation of how those lesser-known other facets of AI exist:
1. **Robotics:** It could be a combination of rule-based systems, sensors, along with language and visual processing, and a control system. The movement of arms is precise due to the control system, and sensors provide *interactivity*. It can incorporate deep learning to improve its capabilities.
2. Control Systems: They include the mechanism through which mathematical calculations guide the process's speed and momentum. The famous PID controller allows for the automated driving of a line-follower bot. It captures the *precision* aspect of intelligence and makes informed decisions.
3. **Game engines:** Games have always been a part of computer systems, and the intelligence they derive comes from the fast computations and memory management of the computers. They can pre-compute the future possibilities while designing the current game flow. A famous example is the chess engine and the game of cards.
4. Material technology: The inherent properties of different materials and nanoparticles contain an intelligence that is now opening doors for nanoAI agents. A particular example is the smart nanomaterials that find usage in biomedicine. Others include stealth technology to make things invisible and smart building materials.


Let's now quickly cover ML and DL, which are promising a good future for AI, primarily because of the exponential growth in data and computational capabilities in recent years.
Here, we can't feed in all the possible decision rules and pattern matchings beforehand. However, it is allowed to pre-compute a definitive path for decision-making, called models. The machine has to make statistical inferences about the decision rules and patterns to create the models from the limited examples available (or data).


The few scenarios that we make available to the machine are called training data.
If the training data are labelled from the real world (like a cat image, along with the label *Cat*), the learning that happens is called "supervised earning." The machine then figures out the labels for the unobserved test data by itself. Generally, we do three sets of tasks here: regression, classification, and ranking.
Similarly, if we train it without the labels to make some associations among the given scenarios (or training data) - like segment or cluster, and do the same with any unobserved scenario, then it is called unsupervised learning.


There are several different mathematical models or algorithms for these two types of learning.


{: .new }
There is a third type of learning called reinforcement learning, where we create an agent that learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.


Below are a few terms that need further attention:
Natural Language Processing (NLP): process to make a system or agent that can understand and generate human language, enabling it to interact with users through text or speech.
Computer Vision: image processing to make systems or agents capable of processing and interpreting visual information, allowing them to understand and interact with images and videos.
Neural Networks: Models designed to mimic brain functionality through neurons, also called deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for vision tasks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential data, are used to build intelligent agents or systems.


Self-learning agents are those that learn in real time - preparing the data for itself, training, and responding to the calls for action.
These are not common nowadays, as multitasking requires additional power. There is always some time delay between model training and using it for inferencing. But this delay can be shortened by using multiple agents and by using the techniques of transfer learning and foundation models.


Developing an artificially intelligent agent requires expertise in AI, machine learning, and software development, as well as access to suitable data and computational resources.

It's also important to consider the ethical and practical implications of deploying AI agents in various applications.



## AI: A Boon or a Bane


In the early 80s and 90s, there used to be questions like, "Is science a boon or a bane?". The science, as we knew it then, has had its share of positives and negatives. We have coped and adjusted with time. Mostly, we have chosen science over everything else, as it paved the way for economic progress and well-being.


As we grapple with the realities of AI, the question remains the same, but it entails a severe consequence.


AI is proving to be helpful in our quest to know more, model natural life processes, and give more power to decision-making in the hands of humans. That is the sole reason for its growth and popularity. Through AI, we are feeding the right content to the individual as per their liking, deciding optimal routes while driving, and approving or rejecting loan applications, to say the least. We have language models and seamless automated translations. The goal is to automate some hectic manual tasks.


AI is science, and its impacts are going to be visible in human societies in a few years. Are we going to accept all it has to offer? Do we have the freedom to be selective? AI is not going to impact us directly. It is going to change a few ideals and establishments that we have anchored on for a stable society, like human rights, sexuality, and democracy. beliefs and identities will change, and new ideals will emerge. Although such things are not new and have been happening since time immemorial, AI will change the pace. With great momentum, there is little time to adjust and react, and this throws a complete new form of possibilities and properties.


The goodness or badness of AI is not a topic to be discussed. The point of contention is how dear we hold our existing beliefs and ideals and how true they are to rightfully become the anchors of society. If AI makes us discard some prevalent evil system, like the corruption of bureaucracy, that is a good thing for society. But, with the same enthusiasm, it can replace an existing best system, like liberal democracy, with something new, like autocratic AI agents. And they are both equally likely to happen. Now it's up to us to allow the change or adapt to the changed world order and make the best of it.


{: .warning}
AI will impact humans, but indirectly. It will affect our principles and institutions before touching us. We'll be impacted based on our relationship with these principles and institutions.


When judging the AI, it is very important that we assess ourselves first. A crash course on 'freedom from the known' is needed for humans to grasp what AI is and how it is gaining momentum. We are outsourcing our decision-making to the wisdom of AI, for good or for bad. The technology is feeding into our fantasies and desires - to aggravate them further.
We don't know our own learning process and want to discard AI as just another science fraught with errors. The important point is: do we even know how errorneous we ourselves are?


AI systems and use cases are already being flooded into the market - a few by innovators and a few by economic forces. Another form of push for AI comes from spectators. Because there is hype, there is investment, leading to more and more spectacular leaps and advancements.

{: .important}
If we want to train an AI to do what humans want, we need to study humans first.



## AI and the fear
When you ask the question, *Is AI going to be bad for us?" obviously you are being critical. But the real question is: do you know what you are asking?
There is an aspect of *Us* vs. *They* in your question. Us means humans, and they mean AI agents of the future that are going to be far more intelligent. But, how are you sure that we are separate? How do you know that we are not a simulated reality? What sets you apart from simulated intelligence?


You might answer that we have consciousness and willpower that set us apart from the AI agents. But isn't our so-called willpower being hacked by these AI algorithms when we realise that the decisions made by the AI are better and more efficient than what we could have come up with with our own consciousness? When you allow a YouTube recommendation, you say the machine knows me more than I do. When you allow the GPS to help you navigate, you say I trust science more than my cognition.


So, the ruling on AI has already started. It is not about a future war between humanity and a bot army. It is about manipulation and your quest for knowledge.


With advancements in intelligent systems, the boundaries are getting blurred as to where reality ends and where AI starts.
Humans are hooked while the machines are learning.



## AI is farce, but useful


There is a famous saying in the machine learning world: "All models are wrong, but some are useful."

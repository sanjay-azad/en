## Introduction
AI is an umbrella term, where machines are made intelligent in terms of decision making and cognition.

There are few measures of intelligence as a human - understanding patterns, decision making, language understanding and emotions. An intelligent system having emotions is the most difficult to achieve and is the most dreaded feature.

Machine learning and deep learning are some of the ways to have an artificial-intelligent agent. Others include robotics, control system, game engines, etc.

Here, we teach a machine to function over the above mentioned measures - when all the possible scenarios in a use case are not available beforehand to the machine. Thus the machine has to make out statistical inferences from the available limited example scenarios.

The few scenarios that we make available to the machine are called training data. 

If the scenarios are labelled with output from real world, the learning that happens is called **supervised learning**. The machine then makes out the label for the onobserved scenarios by itself.

Similarly, if we train it without labels to make some associations among the given scenarios - like rank or segment/cluster them, and do the same with any unobserved scenario then it is called the **unsupervised learning**.

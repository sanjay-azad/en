### Hello, 

This is *Sanjay Azad* - a 28 years old having expertise in machine learning, quantitative analytics and signal processing.
I have completed post-graduation (B.Tech + M.Tech) from [IIT Bombay] in 2016, from the [Department of Electrical Engineeering] with specialization in Communication and Signal processing.


On technical side, I got exposure to [MATLAB] for computational processing, and [Python] for data science. I now have 6+ years of professional experience in quantitative analytics, data science and application development.


I am passionate about nature, so have developed gardening as a hobby. Except that I am vocal for sustainable development in the sense that resources have to be used skillfully.


I live in India, and have visited several of its cities across states. I believe in connecting with our roots and that we have to strengthen our villages, improvise on agriculture - in sustainability as well as profitability, and keep a check on water and air pollution.


Global warming[^1] is a big threat - not just in terms of rising water levels but also the amount of heat India is facing in past couple of years. This poses a tremendous opportunity to capitalise on the excess energy we are receiving from the sun.


Indian culture and history has been a source of fascination to me. Its traditional and ancient knowledge system woven into the fabric of mythology and religious philosophies (spirituality) are astounding. They can prove to be a disruptive technology for human cognition in today's world of chaos and sufferings.


I am a student of science and is a proud critical thinker and seeker of knowledge.


The information, facts and theories that I have acquired over my life period - those are my assets, and I am willing to disseminate them over here to a larger audience. The blogs are going to be from diverse background, but mostly will have following flavours:

- Finance
- Machine learning
- Deep learning
- History and polity
- Nature and Agriculture
- Indian culture and philosophies
